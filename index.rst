Introduction to Sphinx
======================
Sphinx is the documentation tool of choice for the Python language community, and increasingly also for other programming languages and tools. It was originally created in 2008 to document the Python language itself.

Over the past eight years, it has turned into a robust and mature solution for software documentation. It includes a number of features that writers expect, such as:

Single Source Publishing
------------------------
* :ref:`Output HTML, PDF, ePub, and more`
* :ref:`Content reuse through includes`
* :ref:`Conditional includes based on content type and tags`
* :ref:`Multiple mature HTML themes that provide great user experience on mobile and desktop`
* :ref:`Referencing across pages, documents, and projects`
* :ref:`Index and Glossary support`
* :ref:`Internationalization support`

It also has practical and powerful tools for documenting software specifically, including:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Semantic referencing of software concepts, including classes, functions, programs, variables, etc.
Including code comments in documentation output for many programming languages
Tools for documenting HTTP APIs
Extensions with the Python language
A vast array of third party extensions providing powerful new roles and directives
